          <h3 class="h3-1">Integrated Development Environment(IDE) :</h3>
          <p>
            An Integrated Development Environment is a application that provides
            support to develop software applications. IDE is one of the foremost
            components of a coder's/developer's life as it integrates all the
            developer tools into a single graphical user interface(GUI).
          </p>
          <p>
            An IDE usually includes source code editor, build automation tools
            and a debugger, apparently it is not limited only to them. The
            compiler translates the source code/program most probably into
            computer language i.e Binary language which is compatible for a
            computer to execute.
          </p>
          <p>So let's dive into some popular IDE's across the World.</p>

                  notifications and incorporated documentation. The platform
                  uses and equipped the flexibility of this development
                  environment and gives into a powerful development engine.
                  Developers who need to build websites written in PHP, Ruby on
                  Rails, can still use this IDE by adding plug-ins.

                  reorganizing multiple small projects, it has some stability
                  issues and runs slowly, therefore, the professional developers
                  may prefer a more powerful IDE.

                  open-source, and part of Xcode, which is a collection of tools
                  for making apps for Apple devices such as the iPad, iPhone,

                  viewing releases and earlier versions of the group through the
                  Apple Developer website. Xcode allows tools to control all our

                  testing, optimizing, and presenting it to the App Store.
