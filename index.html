                devices. For the simpler task, it may be easier to use a

              <p>
                <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">Eclipse</a> is a free to
                use open source editor useful for beginners and pros too.
                Originally was a Java environment but as of now, it has a wide
                range of capabilities thanks to a large number of plug-ins and
                extensions. The standard edition of eclipse comes with java and
                plugin development tooling. There is even plenty of other
                packages to choose from that includes tools for charting,
                modeling, reporting, testing and building GUIs. The Eclipse
                Marketplace Client gives users access to a treasure trove of
                plugins and information supplied by an expanding community of
                developers. Before the introduction of Android, Studio Eclipse
                was used for developing android apps as it was considered best

                software, the many options may be intimidating to newcomers.
                Eclipse doesnâ??t have all of the same features as IntelliJ
                IDEA, but it is open source.

              customizable IDE that performs consistently across all platforms,
              so it is great for developers who frequently switch between
              workspaces. The plug-in framework lets users tweak this IDE to
              meet their needs. Built around a plugin framework, Code:: Blocks
              can be extended with plugins. Any kind of functionality can be
              added by installing/coding a plugin. For instance, compiling and
              debugging functionality is already provided by plugins!

                features, it is a relatively lightweight IDE, so itâ??s not
                suited for larger projects. It is a great tool for beginners,
                but advanced coders may be frustrated with the limitations.

                Aptana Studio 3 (click here) is a massive improvement over its

              <p>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode </a>
                is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS
                containing a suite of software development tools developed by
                Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
                It is free, open-source, and part of Xcode, which is a
                collection of tools for making apps for Apple devices such as
                the iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Registered developers can download
                preview releases and prior versions of the suite through the
                Apple Developer website. Integration with Cocoa Touch makes
                development in the Apple environment a breeze, and you can
                enable services such as Game Center or Passbook with a single
                mouse click. Built-in communication with the developerâ??s
                website helps users produce fully functioning apps on the fly.

              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Drawbacks</span>: You obviously need an Apple machine to
                run Xcode, and keep in mind that you need a developers license
                to upload apps to the Apple Store.

                <a href="https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/">
                  Komodo IDE
                </a>
                is an integrated development environment (IDE) for dynamic
                programming languages. It was introduced in May 2000. Many of
                Komodoâ??s features are derived from an embedded Python
                interpreter. It has an open-source counterpart known as Komodo
                edit. Both Komodo Edit and IDE support user customizing via
                plug-ins and macros. Komodo plug-ins are based on Mozilla
                Add-ons and extensions can be searched for, downloaded,
                configured, installed and updated from within the application.

              <p>
                <span>Drawbacks</span>: One of the few complaints about Komodo
                is that the free version doesnâ??t enable all of the features,
                but the premium version is still considered well-worth the cost.

              <h3>10. RubyMine</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> is
                another superb IDE by JetBrains that offers a 30-day free trial
                and costs $687 annually. As its name implies, RubyMine is a
                favorite among Ruby enthusiasts; however, this IDE supports
                other programming languages as well. Easy navigation, logical
                workflow organization, and compatibility with most platforms
                make RubyMine a workplace favorite.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Drawbacks</span>: Your machine needs at least 4GB of RAM
                for RubyMine to run smoothly. Some users also complain about the
                lack of GUI customization options, also non-availability of
                standard edition is an issue.
